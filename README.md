# Mission to Mars Challenge

### Overal Goals:
* The purpose of this analysis was to generate a web scraping python code that would scrape news headlines, news summaries, the most recent data on mars, the latest images of Mars from the JPL at NASA and pictures of Mars' hemispeheres. This code was automated via Splinter and rendered to HTML via Flask. The resulting image below shows the ultimate HTML render with additional Bootstrap elements to resize the page for mobile devices and color the action button.
